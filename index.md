# First Problem Title

**Informal Description**:
Beth Brown has recently been elected as a community representative. With her new role, she has to visit different families and ask them about life in the neighborhood. However, a lot of people have questions for Beth and often stop her to ask about improvements for the neighborhood, which tires her out quite a bit!

Today Beth has decided to visit the Koch household; what path will ensure that Beth gets asked the least amount of questions on the way from her house (Brown) to the Kochs?

> **Formal Description**:
> Beth's house and her community can be represented with a weighted, undirected graph; each vertex of the graph is a household or outdoor venue in the neighborhood, and each weighted edge connecting two vertices is the amount of questions Beth gets asked on her way from one location to another.

> Using Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Beth's house to the Koch's house--the shortest path being the one with which Beth gets asked the least number of questions.

>  * Input: A graph of 20 vertices (labelled with last names of each household/name of outdoor spot) and 25 edges (labelled with weights representing number of questions)
>  * Output: A list of vertices representing the path from Beth's house to the Koch household

> *Note: Edges with a weight greater than 7 are colored red to indicate high value paths for easier visuals)*

**Graph Problem/Algorithm**: SSSP - Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Solution code:**

```python
G = nx.Graph()
verts = ['Brown','Smith','park','Singh',"O'Neil",'Lewis','pond','Adebe','Patel','Koch',
        'Uysal','creek','Jones','Khan','Keen','Baird','forest','Zeng','Davis', 'Garcia']
G.add_nodes_from(verts)

# Add random weighted edges between vertices
G.add_weighted_edges_from([('Brown','Adebe', 15),
                            ('Brown','Baird', 6),
                            ('Brown','Zeng',11),
                            ('Smith','O\'Neil', 6),
                            ('park','Keen', 10),
                            ('park','forest', 8),
                            ('park','Uysal', 12),
                            ('Singh','O\'Neil', 3),
                            ('Singh','Jones', 3),
                            ('Singh','forest', 5),
                            ('O\'Neil','Koch', 11),
                            ('Lewis','Baird', 7),
                            ('pond','Keen', 4),
                            ('pond','Adebe', 3),
                            ('pond','Lewis', 2),
                            ('Adebe','creek', 2),
                            ('Adebe', 'Khan', 7),
                            ('Patel','Khan', 15),
                            ('Jones','Garcia', 4),
                            ('Jones','creek', 1),
                            ('forest', 'Zeng', 5),
                            ('Koch','Davis', 9),
                            ('Khan','Keen', 6),
                            ('Keen','Baird', 14),
                            ('Davis','Garcia', 8)])

# Color edges depending on weight
elarge = [(u, v) for (u, v, d) in G.edges(data=True) if d["weight"] > 7]
esmall = [(u, v) for (u, v, d) in G.edges(data=True) if d["weight"] <= 7]

# Draw graph
pos= nx.circular_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, font_weight='bold', node_size=1000, node_color='orange')

# Draw edges
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=elarge, edge_color="red", style="dotted", width=2)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=esmall, style="dotted", width=2)

# Draw weights of edges
edge_weight = nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight')
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels = edge_weight) 

# Show graph
plt.show(G)

# Find the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm
shortest_path = nx.dijkstra_path(G, 'Brown', 'Koch')
print(shortest_path)
```

**Output**

```python
['Brown', 'Zeng', 'forest', 'Singh', "O'Neil", 'Koch']
```

**Interpretation of Results**:
The shortest path from Beth's house to the Koch residency involves traversing the path from the Zeng household, the forest, Singh household, and O'Neil household, before finally reaching the Koch's house. Using this path, the total number of questions Beth would receive on her way is 35.




# Problem 2: Kim Just Moved in

**Informal Description**: 
Kim recently moved into house number 1 in a new neighborhood, and she wants to meet all her neighbors! She wants to see if she would be able to visit all her neighbors within the neighborhood (by checking if the neighborhood is connected). Additionally, she wants to organize the houses by levels in the neighborhood, so that she can easily remember which neighbors live in what part of the neighborhood.

> **Formal Description**:
>  * Input: A graph of 21 nodes and 31 edges - edges labelled with street names, nodes labelled with house numbers.
>  * Output: (String) Strings letting the user know if the graph is connected, and lists of the grouped nodes in each level (boolean and lists that I converted to string for ease)

```

**Output**

Is the neighborhood connected: True <br>   

These are the houses in each level, each list represents a level: <br>   

[1]
[2, 3]
[4, 21, 19]
[5, 6, 18, 15, 10]
[20, 8, 11, 7, 13, 14, 12]
[16, 9, 17]

**Interpretation of Results**:
The BFS algorithm is used to traverse a graph in a breadth-first manner, i.e., visiting all the nodes at a given level before moving to the next level. In this case, the BFS algorithm is used to determine if it is possible for Kim to visit all her neighbors without leaving the neighborhood, and also to organize the houses into levels within the neighborhood.

The output shows that the neighborhood is connected, which means that Kim can visit all her neighbors without leaving the neighborhood. The output also provides a list of the houses in each level of the neighborhood. For example, house number 1 is in the first level, house numbers 2 and 3 are in the second level, and so on. This information can be helpful for Kim to easily remember which neighbors live in what part of the neighborhood.

# Problem #4: Meet the neighbors!
**Informal Description**: 
Katie has recently moved into a new neighborhood named "Kruskal's Neighborhood". She is eager to make friends with her neighbors and wantes to know the best way to visit every house while taking the least amount of steps as possible. In addition to the best path, she also wants to know the total number of steps of said path. 

> **Formal Description**:
>  * Input: A graph of 21 nodes and 31 edges - nodes labelled with house's owners name, edges weighted by number of steps each edge represents.
>  * Output: (int) the total number of steps for the shortest path arounnd the neighborhood, and a list of edges to follow to take the path with the least number of steps.

161
```

**Interpretation of Results**:
The shortest possible number of steps to reach evey house on Katie's walk around the neighborhood is 161 steps. The edges taken to get said path are as follows: [('tyler', 'ella'), ('rob', 'julia'), ('kelly', 'livi'), ('livi', 'justin'), ('katie', 'ana'), ('ana', 'john'), ('cora', 'rob'), ('julia', 'mike'), ('mike', 'kelly'), ('john', 'matt'), ('justin', 'michael'), ('michael', 'rana'), ('mike', 'emma'), ('kelly', 'becka'), ('rana', 'matt'), ('john', 'ella'), ('molly', 'annie'), ('becka', 'taylor'), ('rana', 'diya'), ('cora', 'molly')]. Kruskal's algorithim is used to navigate through the graph, choosing edges to keep (starting from the shortest number of steps going up to the largest number of steps) and outputting said edges. In addition to using the built in networkx algorithim, I added a for statement that keeps track of the edge weights as they were chosen throughout the algorithim. This is how I was able to determine the total number of steps following the path with the least number of steps.
